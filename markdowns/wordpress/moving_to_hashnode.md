# Moving over to Hashnode
It has been eons since I've created another blog post on Wordpress, and it is to my dismay that I'll be shifting towards the Hashnode blogging platform instead. Before I outline the specific reasons for doing so, I would briefly summarize my activities post my previously old, outdated collections as follows:

* Being pre-occupied with several cool technologies pertaining to Cloud, Mobile and Network Security in McAfee, the Cybersecurity company. To be more specific:
	- Served the **McAfee Mobile Cloud Security** service, focusing on 
		- design, development and maintence of VPN-based backend services, secured with delegated authorization via Oauth 2.0
		- contributing to the Android codebase, ensuring compatibility with Chrome OS as well
		- Play Store link: [McAfee Mobile Cloud Security](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcafee.mmcs&hl=en_IN&gl=US)
	- Involved in product lines providing connectivity for
		- Site-to-Site company-wide locations via *SD-WAN* and *VPN* tech
		- Multicast, high-bandwidth connectivity via *SD-WAN* based [GRE tunneling](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2784)
		- Edge Locations: [Points of Presence](https://trust.mcafee.com/web/)
	- *coveralls* ( automation and load-testing frameworks, CI/CD, metrics and logging pipeline bindings )
- In addition to this, I've contributed to a repertoire of FOSS projects, and passed on my experience gained thereof by pursuing online course instruction: [Open-Source Contribution: Guide for Developers on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/oss-developers/)  I'd appreciate it if you would check it out!

I will try my best to continue blogging in the meantime, however in view of being productive, I've developed certain practices which overtime have distanced me from blogging on Wordpress. I've no grudges against it, although it's oriented towards non-technical audiences, so I'm shifting towards a tech blog hosting.

For those already in this space, you'd root for either [DevBlog](dev.to) or the more popular [Medium](medium.com). While these are great options (and arguably better than [HashNode](hashnode.com)), I'm looking for certain characteristics offered, such as:

 - Markdown support (all 3 hands down)
 - Low saturation ( as opposed to Medium )
 - Provision for a custom domain ( HashNode hands down)
 - Monetization, if permissible

The domain you must revert for the time being is [sidsrinivas.hashnode.dev](sidsrinivas.hashnode.dev), where you can expect new blog posts from me later on.
At the moment, Ciao Wordpress!
